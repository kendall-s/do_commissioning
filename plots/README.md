# Dissolved Oxygen Instrument Commissioning - Charts
## Background
Plots shown below were produced from data collected in the commissioning process of two newly procured Dissolved Oxygen analysers. The two new instruments are planned to replace the existing 20 year old instrument on RV Investigator.

Please see the commissioning report for more information.

# 3.1 Independent Iodate Standards

## 3.1.1 Iodate Standards across Instruments Boxplot

> Data produced by dispensing 10mL of Potassium Iodate standard from an additional Dosimat not used for calibration.

# 3.2 Repeated Deep Sample Measurement: 1

## 3.2.1.1 Samples from One Niskin per Instrument Boxplot

> Samples were collected from deep CTD deployment (1000db), in this section 6 samples were collected from each niskin and, samples from that 1 niskin were then analysed by 1 instrument. All samples were collected by Kendall.

## 3.2.2.1 Samples from Two Niskins for all Instruments Boxplot

> Samples were collected from deep CTD deployment (1000db), in this section 6 samples were collected from two niskins, totalling 12 samples. 2 samples from each niskin were analysed on each instrument, meaning each instrument analysed 4 samples.

# 3.3 Atmospheric Sample: All Instruments

## 3.3.1 Atmospheric Saturated Sample Boxplot

> Using the atmospheric sample setup, 12 samples were collected at 21.5°C with air pressure of 1011.1 atm. 4 samples at random were analysed by each instrument. All samples were collected by Alicia.

# 3.4 Atmospheric Saturated Sample: One Instrument

## 3.4.1 Atmospheric Saturated Sample: Instrument New B

> Using the atmospheric sample setup, 12 samples were collected. All of these samples were analysed on one of the new instruments. Instrument New B was used, this was the instrument which was installed into the Hydrochemistry lab to replace the old instrument. Samples were taken at 21.5°C with air pressure of 1010.7 atm.

# 3.5 Water Profile Comparison

## 3.5.1 Water Profile Plot

> Replicate water samples were taken at multiple depths for a basic water column profile. There were niskin fired replicates as well as sample duplicates taken for each niskin. The sample duplicates were split between the two instruments test, New A and Old.

# 3.6 Repeated Deep Sample Measurements: 2

## 3.6.1 Deployment 2 Replicates Boxplot

> Replicate water samples were taken at multiple depths for a basic water column profile. There were niskin fired replicates as well as sample duplicates taken for each niskin. The sample duplicates were split between the two instruments test, New A and Old.
